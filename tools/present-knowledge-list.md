* Virtualization 2
I know what it is and kinda how to get a VM running

* Containers 3
I have used them before but have the general feeling that they only work because I'm lucky

* Vim 7
I am pretty comfortable using it but don't know a lot of the advanced techniques.
I learned macros today though so I'm pretty happy about that.
q + letter from a to z to record
q again to stop recording
@ + letter to play macro

* Virtual Private Servers 2
I know what they are and some of their attributes, but I don't have the money to try them out (yet)
