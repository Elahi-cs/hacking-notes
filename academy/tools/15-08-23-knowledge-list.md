How much I know:
Penetration Testing 0
Different kinds of security 0 (What is opsec, what is infosec, why so many secs)
NMap 1 (I know what it is and some things it does)
Networks 2 ( I know what they are and some of their attributes )
Bash Scripting 3 ( if you let me use Google)
Linux Console 4 (being generous)
Web Requests 4 (I know a GET and a POST when I see them)
Programming 6 (also being generous, however I know nothing of security-oriented programming other than avoiding SQL injection attacks)
