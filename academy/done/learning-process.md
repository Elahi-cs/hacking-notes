All languages follow the same principles (R. D. Tennent):
1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.

A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

PERSONAL Goal: Dip my toes into InfoSec. Try to learn as much as I can of it before uni starts. See if it's what I want to do for the rest of my life.
PERSONAL Goal with the Course: Finish it before September 7th. Do 2-hours a day if I remain unemployed.

Failing is an unavoidable and essential part of learning. Experience is built on failures.

[The concept of the Learning Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid)

"Do the Real Thing" -> Simulate, Model, or Experience -> Design Lessons -> Hands-On Workshops -> Watch Demonstration -> Attend Exhibits -> Watch Videos -> View Images -> Hear -> Read
Descending priority: Do -> Say and Write -> See and Hear -> See -> Hear -> Read
(There's criticisms of this model but it's a good starting point)

Usual thing: Take breaks, stay calm, pay attention, don't stress about learning too slowly.

Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.

Fear-avoidance checklist:
1. Have we already worked through all the material?
2. Have we already seen what is being taught and how it is being taught?
3. Do we already have to have the skills that are expected of us?

Side-note which might be worthy of therapy: Why are my goals usually to impress and please others?

When faced with a problem, we set our limitations ourselves, not by others. (Why not add pillars and ropes in the Trolley Problem?)

Example: Questions for the Trolley Problem
How far away is the train?
How fast is the train going?
How much time do we have to try to save everyone?
How can we save everyone?
What tools do we have at our disposal?

Documentation guidelines:
1. It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
3. Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.

Focused people are not only enormously persistent and tenacious, but they are also hardly distracted or discouraged.
If we know our goal, it is easier to align our focus accordingly. 
This, in turn, makes us much more efficient, and we get closer to our goal much faster and do not let ourselves be distracted by external influences.

Document working time to find patterns and gain insight:

* current emotional state (calm, nervous, worried, happy, depressed, relaxed, etc.)
* the previous flow of the day so far (also with one word)
* place of work
* working hours
* duration
* sleep
* inserted breaks
* duration of the breaks
* and anything else we can think of.

That way we will gain information into how the attention span is behaving.

Only the person who has taken the exact same journey as you can evaluate you and your decisions. Everything else is only assumptions.

POSSIBLE GOOD IDEA: Go back to the Learning Process section when stuck/frustrated/sad/afraid.

Relationship-Oriented-Questioning Model

Frustration is temporary.
